### Overview
This Application is a resource for teachers to upload and share lessons with filtering tools to find grade or subject specific lessons and a comment feature to allow for user feedback.

### Getting Started
To get the application started, clone the project, navigate to the p5-frontend folder, and run npm start in your terminal. If a window does not automatically open, go to your browser and open "http://localhost:3000". Make sure to also clone the p5-backend file (https://github.com/Ekosma/P5_Backend) to be able to save and see data. 

Navigation
On the main page you will see lessons that have been uploaded to your database. You can navigate to upload your own PDF lesson, or view other lessons. When viewing lessons, comments can be made on them as well.
